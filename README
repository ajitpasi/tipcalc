This is a test project developed for codepath.

This is a simple tip calculator. You can specifiy tip percentages for various service levels and then compute tips for each service level.
The project was built from scratch with no prior experience with iOS development.

Time Spent : 6 hours

Completed User Stories:
1. The app has two views. One view where you can specify the amount and service level and you can see the tip calculated.
2. The app has a settings page where you can specify percentages for various service levels, these settings are persistent
and effective across views. The percentages specified are validated to be valid (in the range 0-99)
